## Assumptions
* Cannot add a book if one already exists with the same ISBN
* Cannot borrow a book that has no copies remaining
* Cannot return a book that doesn't exist in the library
* Overall it's pretty simple and limited to cover the basic exercise 
  * No user authentication / roles
  * More books can be returned than were avaialable
  * Books cannot be updated
  * A borrowed book may be deleted which then make the book impossible to return 


## Additional Features
* There is a debug endpoint to seed some books
* Thread safe and concurrent as per the exercise
* Time did not permit the completion of bonus features jwt authentication or rate limiting
